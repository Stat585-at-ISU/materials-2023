# Welcome to Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis

---

## Why Data Technologies?

Not all data ... 

- lives in spread sheets, 

- is nice and clean, 

- fits in a machine's main memory.

As statisticians we **cannot** always rely on other people and disciplines to get the data into a nice and tidy format.

---

## What are we going to do?

This course deals with concepts, skills, and tools related to 

- acquiring and combining data from different sources, 

- rearranging and summarising data,

- communicating methods and results in form of graphics, packages, and web applications.


... along the way ... make our process as transparent and reproducible as possible.

---

## Data comes in a lot of different formats

... as sound 
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="data/i-like-statistics_hh.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

... as image
<img src="data/striations.jpg" width=150>

... in a monitoring device
<img src="data/fitbit.png" width=250>


---

## 

```{r}
library(tuneR)
ils_class <- readWave("data/i-like-statistics_hh.wav")
str(ils_class)
```

```{r, echo =FALSE, cache = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ils_df <- data.frame(left=ils_class@left, right=ils_class@right)
ils_df$time <- 1:nrow(ils_df)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
ils_df %>% ggplot(aes(time, right)) + geom_line()
```


---

## Data from images


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(magick)
img <- image_read('data/imgres.jpg')
image_info(img)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE, cache= TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3}
im_mat <- image_data(img)

img_df <- data.frame(expand.grid(x = 1:dim(im_mat)[2], y = 1:dim(im_mat)[3]))
img_df$red <- as.numeric(im_mat[1,,])
img_df$green <- as.numeric(im_mat[2,,])
img_df$blue <- as.numeric(im_mat[3,,])
p1 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = red) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "red") + theme(legend.position="none")
p2 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = green) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "green")+ theme(legend.position="none")
p3 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = blue) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "blue")+ theme(legend.position="none")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, nrow=1)
```

... what kind of birds are [these](data/imgres.jpg)?

---

## ... there's an R package for that!

answer almost independent from the question asked ... obvious advantages

disadvantages

- finding a needle in a haystack? - problem of riches: which is the best solution, is there a good solution?

- often a solution to a different problem - can we extend/append functionality? how?

- packages are of varying quality - we need to be able to assess code for its performance

... these are some of the problems we will be dealing with.

## Grades

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Reading & Blogs | 15% |
| Labs | 40% |
| *Final Project* | |
|   report | 30% |
|   presentation | 15% |

---

## Blogs and Reading

- assigned reading each week

- write a blog entry in response to a related question

- blog entries are due on midnight the following Thursday.

- this week's reading and blog: later
---

## Labs

- during class time on every other Thursday (starting with Thursday, Feb 2nd) 

- you will be partnered (randomly) in groups of 3 to 4

- lab assignments are designed to be finished during class time, but 'finishing touches' can be applied until the following Monday, 10pm. 

- if you cannot attend the lab, please let me know beforehand. Nevertheless, you are expected to do the work!

---

## Attendance

- I expect you to attend class: there will be a substantial amount of time devoted to 'hands-on' examples on the computers. Make use of that time!

- Class 'attendance': 
    + in-person sessions at [1445 Lagomarcino](https://www.fpm.iastate.edu/roomscheduling/room.asp?room_id=128). 
    + I will also provide a zoom link for synchronous attendance. 
In case you are 'zooming in'. Keep your microphone muted unless you ask a question, but turn the camera on.

- In case you do not feel well, take care of yourself and stay home. However, you are expected to catch up with the material.

## Stuck in a problem? How to get help

There's lots of ways to get help in case you are stuck:

1. Google is your friend! in particular, stackoverflow and R help are usually great resources,

2. ask a team member,

3. write email to the instructor with your question, but please avoid any [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+does+lmgtfy+mean?) questions!


---

## Asking good questions

is a learned and valuable skill! 

Have a look at:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

---

## This week's blog post

- Due Thursday midnight, Jan 26

- Reading material: follow the links on the previous page

- What you are asked to do: on the R help or stackoverflow, answer at least one question

- Document which question you answered (link to your answer).

- Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading.
