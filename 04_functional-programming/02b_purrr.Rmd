## From Lab 2

Folder of csv files with data scraped from press logs: 

```{r}
csvs <- dir("data", pattern="presslog-", full.names = TRUE)
csvs
```
--

Make this vector a part of a data set:

```{r}
results <- data.frame(origin = csvs)
```

--

Now we want to read the data inside the csv files. 
One file we would read as: `read_csv(origin[1])`

---

## List Variables

`purrr::map` applies function `.f` to each element of a variable: 

```{r}
results <- results %>% mutate(
  data = origin %>% purrr::map(.f = readr::read_csv, 
                               show_col_types = FALSE)
)

str(results)
```

---

## List Variables

`results$data` is a list column (or list variable). 

List-columns are columns of a
data frame where each element is
a list or vector instead of an atomic
value. 

--

Specifically, each element of `results$data` is a data set. This makes `results` a **nested data set**: 

```{r}
head(results$data[[1]])
```
---

## Mapping

- `purrr` [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/purrr.pdf)

take each element of a list (or vector) and apply function `.f` to it

Then return a

| Return | Function |
|---|---|
| list | map |
| numeric vector | map_dbl |
| logical vector | map_lgl |
| data frame | map_df |

--

`purrr` also implements very powerful ways of reshaping lists

class: inverse

## Your turn

We have been looking at the object `got_chars` in the `repurrrsive` package. 

- What happens, when you apply the function `purrr::transpose` on the list?

- What does the length of the transposed object signify?

- Can we turn the transposed object into a data frame? into a tibble?

---

A tibble it is! How do we get the lists out of the data? - we unnest!

```{r}
library(repurrrsive)
transpose(got_chars) %>% names()

got_chars_tbl <- as_tibble(transpose(got_chars))
got_chars_tbl
```

---

# unnesting 

`nest` and `unnest` are functions in the package `tidyr` to work with [nested data frames](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html)

`tidyr` 1.3.0 has just been released (Jan 24 2023) https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/news/index.html

which brings some syntactic changes with it: [new syntax](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html#new-syntax)


```{r}
got_chars_tbl %>% unnest(cols=1:6)
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

The tibble `got_chars_tbl` is created by transposing the `got_chars` object and casting it into a tibble:

```{r}
got_chars_tbl <- as_tibble(transpose(got_chars))
```

> The `unnest` function takes all elements out of a list object and inserts them into the data set:

```{r eval=FALSE}
got_chars_tbl %>% unnest("url")
```

Why does `got_chars_tbl %>% unnest("books")` not work?

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn


We fix the empty list in element 11 of `books` and change it to a list of an empty string instead:
```{r}
got_chars_tbl$books[11] <- list("")
```

What does `got_chars_tbl %>% unnest("books")` do now?



---
class: inverse
## Your Turn


Write a function `chars_to_char` that takes a vector of characters and returns a single character .... does that sound like `paste`?

Apply that function to the `books` variable of `got_chars_tbl`


What does `got_chars_tbl %>% unnest("books")` do now?

Can we apply this idea to other variables, such as `allegiances`?

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn


What is the difference between

```
got_chars_tbl %>% pluck("books") %>% reduce(.f = paste)
```

and 

```
got_chars_tbl %>% pluck("books") %>% 
   map(.f = function(x) reduce(x, .f = paste, sep=", ", .init=""))
```

and how can we get rid of the leading comma?

# Back to Lab 2

The following code extracts the call codes from one of the press logs published by Ames PD:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tabulizer)
codes <- locate_areas("presslogs/PressLog-2023-02-20.pdf", pages=1)

#codes <- c(474.79543,  20.19263, 546.14273, 747.12743)
#names(codes) <- c("top", "left", "bottom", "right")
# codes <- list(codes)

call_codes <- extract_tables("presslogs/PressLog-2023-02-20.pdf", pages=1, area = codes, guess = FALSE)

# turn all the codes into a single string
call_codes <- as.vector(paste(call_codes[[1]][,1], collapse = ""))

call_codes
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

Take the `call_codes` object and create a data frame as shown below.

Make sure to use functionality of the `purrr` package!

```{r echo=FALSE}
call_codes <- read.csv("data/call_codes.csv")
call_codes %>% head()
```

---


```{r eval=FALSE}
# split the string along each comma:
codes_list <- str_split(call_codes, pattern=",")[[1]]

# get rid of leading and trailing white spaces
codes_list <- trimws(codes_list)

# now split the string along each equal symbol:
codes <- str_split(codes_list, pattern="=")
codes_df <- codes %>% purrr::map(.f = function(x) {
  list(code = x[1], description = x[2])
  }) %>% transpose() %>% as_tibble %>% unnest(cols = 1:2)

write.csv(codes_df, "data/call_codes.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## A bigger example

---


## Example: the gapminder project

Part of a quantitative world is our responsibility to make data accessible

- Hans Rosling (2017‚úù) was at the fore-front of providing World Health Statistics (gapminder)

- in R through the package `gapminder` by Jenny Bryan

- Hans Rosling's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

--

Can we describe countries by the way that their life expectancy develops over time?


---

## First Look: gapminder

```{r width = 10}
library(gapminder)

gg <- gapminder %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line(aes(group= country)) + facet_wrap(~continent) 
plotly::ggplotly(gg)
```
--

Most  countries show an increase in life expectancy over time, but not all

---

## Split-Apply-Combine for lists


- `nest` creates list of data frames (split)

- `map` applies function to list object (apply)

- `unnest` moves list results back into a data frame (combine)

--

Usually a good idea to develop code for one example, then generalize 

---

## First Model: US only

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

---

## Model of the US

```{r warning = FALSE}
lm(lifeExp~I(year-1950), data = filter(gapminder, country == "United States"))
```

---
class: inverse
## Your turn:  another country

Pick another country in the gapminder data and derive estimates. 

How do the estimates compare to the US?

---

# Now we want to apply this to all countries

Nest by country: 

```{r}
country_nest <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(year = year - 1950) %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>% nest()
```

Creates a `data` variable with a dataset for each country

```{r}
country_nest$data[[1]] %>% head()
```


---

# List variables: stepping through

The `map` function of the `purrr` package allows us to apply a function to each element of a list.
`map_dbl` returns a double value, `map_df` a data frame. `map` itself returns a list.

```{r}
country_nest <- country_nest %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, function(d) lm(lifeExp~year, data = d))
)
```

---

```{r}
country_nest <- country_nest %>% 
   mutate(
     intercept = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) m$coef[1])
   )

country_nest %>% head()
```

--- 

```{r echo=FALSE}
country_nest <- country_nest %>% 
   mutate(
     slope = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) m$coef[2])
   )
country_nest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = intercept, y = slope, colour = country)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

- Work through the previous example and expand the object `country_nest` by adding the slope from each model as an additional variable

- Plot a scatterplot of slope and  intercept and compare. 

- Advanced: Jenny Bryan is using pretty color schemes for these data at https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder
Can you get those to work for your example? Test with ggplotly.

## Your Turn

Find the data for Canada from `country_nest`

Why does `country_nest$data[[country_nest$country=="Canada"]]` not work?

---

## Nested data frames (cont'd)

We can use the list elements as data inputs:

```{r}
lm(lifeExp~year, data=country_nest$data[[10]])
```


---
class: inverse
## Your Turn (8 mins) 


The goal of this your turn is for you to try out nesting operations on various datasets.

- Nest the `ChickWeight` data in different ways: what are the results of 

```
ChickWeight %>% nest(-Diet)
ChickWeight %>% nest(weight)
ChickWeight %>% nest(Time, weight)
```

- `chickwts` is yet another data set on feeding chicks. Nest it by different feeds. 

- `nest` respects grouping structure introduced by `group_by`. Use `group_by` to nest the `iris` dataset by species.

# Extracting model estimates

```{r}
country_nest %>%
  mutate(
    intercept = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) coef(m)[1]),
    slope = model %>% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(m) coef(m)[2])
  ) %>% head(5)
```

---

## The broom package

Now we have all these models ... 

<img src="images/broom.jpeg" class="cover" width=1000>


---

## The `broom` package

`broom` allows to extract values from models on three levels:

- for each model: `broom::glance`

- for each coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`

- for each value in the dataset: `broom::augment`

--

```{r}
library(broom)
broom::glance(country_nest$model[[1]])
```

---

```{r}
broom::tidy(country_nest$model[[1]])
```

---

```{r}
broom::augment(country_nest$model[[1]])
```

---

##Extract values for each coefficient

Extract coefficients for all countries automatically (hello `map` again!)

```{r}
# works, but we lose the context
coefs = country_nest$model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
head(coefs)
```

---

##Extract values for each coefficient (cont'd)

```{r}
# better, but everything is still stuffed into this strange format
country_nest <- country_nest %>% mutate(
  coefs = model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
) 
country_nest %>% head()
```

---

## Ready to fly!

The opposite of `nest` is `unnest`:

```{r}
coefs <- country_nest %>% select(country, continent, coefs) %>% 
  unnest(cols = coefs)
coefs
```

---

## Reshaping

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height = 4.5}
coefsLong <- coefs %>% pivot_longer(names_to="Statistic", values_to = "Value", 4:7)
coefsTerm <- coefsLong %>% pivot_wider(names_from="term", values_from="Value")
coefsTerm %>% filter(Statistic == "estimate") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `(Intercept)`, y = year)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) + ylab("Slope (year)")
```


---
class: inverse
## Your turn (10 mins)

- Extract other model diagnostics: find the R square value for each model. Draw a visualization of R square by country - can you see a pattern? What does the pattern mean?

- Extract residuals and fitted values for each of the models and store them in a dataset together with country and continent information. 

- Plot residuals across the years and fit a smooth. What does the pattern mean?

- Include predicted Life Expectancy for 2017 into the data set. Then compare predicted life expectancy in 2017 with that in 1950.
