## Package `usethis` and `R packages` book


R package development is not generally linear, we generally need a lot of details on specific things:


`usethis` is a package to help with organizing the workflow in packages as well as other non-package projects

[README](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) gives an overview of the functionality of `usethis`.

[R packages (2ed)](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham is giving a general overview of the workflow with details

## Data in a package

Assume we have the data frame `mydata` (you might consider using a better name :)).

- Data frames must be stored in the `data` folder. Use the command `save` and make sure to set the path to write into the folder `data`. Then you need to start the documentation ...

- Data the `usethis` way: `use_data(mydata)`. This will use the information of the RStudio project to save things into the proper path and give you a reminder what to do next.


```
use_data
function (..., internal = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE, compress = "bzip2")
```

`use_data` places a data object into the `data` folder.

internal data (used by the package not by the users of a package) is placed in the file `sysdata.rda`

# Your Turn

Include the `diamonds` data as a dataset in your package

What does R CMD check say to that?



---

## Data documentation

- Documenting data in packages: https://r-pkgs.org/data.html

```
#' Prices of 50,000 round cut diamonds.
#'
#' A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000
#' diamonds.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{price}{price, in US dollars}
#'   \item{carat}{weight of the diamond, in carats}
#'   ...
#' }
#' @source \url{http://www.diamondse.info/}
"diamonds"
```


General convention is to have a `data.r` file in the folder `R` that consists of data documentation.

## Data provenance

https://r-pkgs.org/data.html

Keep the data set's origin story! 

Origin story has at least two parts: original data and the script that converts the raw data to the R package data:

- script:  has extension `.R` and goes into a folder called `data-raw` (not the `R` folder!!)

- in folder: inst/extdata include (some) of the raw data (csv, pdf, ...)

The folder `inst` is special in an R package: `inst` is a folder that is being unloaded into the R library during the `inst`allation process.

## Your Turn

Expand the `hello` function by sampling from the diamonds data and reporting the carat weight as 

"You are a <carat> carat gem!"


Run R CMD check on this


---

# Using data sets in packages

Activate the data **in your function environment**:

`data(diamonds, envir = environment())`

See also 'Good Practices' under `?data` Details



---

# Examples in packages

- The Roxygen tag `@examples` allows you to write code as an example in the help file.

- Always make use of this feature! It is not only good practice, it is also a first step in checking that your package is running properly - for new packages CRAN expects an example for every function

- Your example has to be **stand alone**, i.e. if you are using some data, it needs to be included in the package.

```
#' @examples
#' # you can include comments
#' x <- 1
#' 5*x
#' hello("this is a test")
```


---

# Checking packages

- The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is the place for publishing packages for general use.

- Once a package is on CRAN it can be installed using the command `install.packages("<package name>")`

- CRAN has installed certain rules that all packages must comply before being uploaded

`devtools::check()` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E` runs these tests on your local package

Similar to `check()` it looks for the package to check in the working directory

---

# Three levels of faults

- **`ERROR`**: severe problem that has to be fixed beofr esubmitting to CRAN - you should fix it anyway

- **`WARNING`**: also has to be fixed before going onto CRAN, but not as severe.

- **`NOTE`**: mild problem. You should try to get rid of all notes before submitting to CRAN, but sometimes there is a specific reason that does not allow you to fix all notes. In that case, write a careful description why this note happens in the submission comments.

---

# Checking cycle

```
R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes 
```

This is what you want to see, but not a likely outcome of your first run in a real package


Checking workflow: 

1. Run `devtools::check()`, or press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E`.

2. Fix the first problem.

3. Repeat until there are no more problems.


---

# Continuous Integration

- one of the problems of ensuring that a package is sound, is to actually *remember* to run the tests

- [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) allows us to create an automatized workflow (written in yaml): e.g. every time you push a change, the package is being built and checked for CRAN compliance

- github actions can be adjusted to specific use cases - for a start use [example actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) :)

- the command `usethis::use_github_actions()` sets up a folder .github > workflows with the  file `R-CMD-check.yaml`. (This will only work out of the box when there is one package in the repo, and the package is not in a subfolder)

---

# Connecting the package to git & github

The `usethis` package allows us to first turn on git (locally):

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

and then create a github repository:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

... and while we are at it, also include a readme file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

---

# Package website

The package `pkgdown` creates web pages based on all the files in a package

`pkgdown` supports making websites for your package (see e.g. [x3ptools](https://heike.github.io/x3ptools/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), ... and soon yours)

Process:

```
pkgdown::build_site()
```


Assuming your package has a github repo, add the `docs` folder to the repo 

In `Settings` for your repo, switch GitHub Pages to the docs folder (see screenshot)
