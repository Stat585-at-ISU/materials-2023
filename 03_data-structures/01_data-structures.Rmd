# Data Types

---

## Basic Data Types

Name | Example
---- | -------
numeric | 2.93
integer | 2
character | "hello world"
logical | TRUE

Convert between data types with **cast operators** 
```
as.character, as.numeric, as.logical, as.integer, ...
```
e.g. `as.numeric("2.394")` or `as.character("3.14159")`

Test whether something has a data type with `is.XXX`, e.g. `is.character("fuzzy puppies")` or `is.logical("abcde")`

---

## Numeric values

Numeric objects have double precision, i.e. work with 53 bits 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
pi <- as.numeric(gsub(" ","","3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433"))
# maximum number of digits that can be shown is 22
print(pi, digits=22)
```
first 15 digits are fine, anything beyond that is suspicious and most likely incorrect


Precision is machine dependent


---

## `.Machine$double.eps`

`.Machine$double.eps` is the machine's difference between two consecutive real valued numbers

```{r}
.Machine$double.eps

1 + .Machine$double.eps == 1
1 + .Machine$double.eps/2 == 1
1 + .Machine$double.eps == 1

```

---

```{r}
.Machine
```


---


# ` 0.15 == 0.1 + 0.05`
# `r 0.15 == 0.1 + 0.05`


---

## Checking for equality

Internal representation is not equal to decimal representation:

```{r}
i <- 0.1 + 0.05
i
if(i==0.15) cat("i equals 0.15") else cat("i does not equal 0.15")
```

--

```{r}
print(i, digits=17)
print(0.15, digits=17)
```
See also https://0.30000000000000004.com/ for an overview of other languages
---

## Checking for equality


Better practice:

```{r}
dplyr::near(i, 0.15)
```

Default tolerance is specified as `.Machine$double.eps^0.5`,
i.e. floating point numbers are pairwise equal.

---

## Factors

Some data has names and a defined numerical ordering:
```{r}
# R constant
month.name
```

Factors are used to store both the numerical values and the associated labels:
```{r}
factor(month.name)
```

By default, R uses alphabetical order for factors...

---

## Factors
```{r}
factor(month.name)
```

By default, R uses alphabetical order for factors...

Set level names to override the default ordering 
```{r}
months <- factor(month.name, levels = month.name)
months
```


---

## Factors

You can access the labels of a factor using `levels()`
```{r}
levels(months)
```

You can access the order of the factor using `as.numeric()`:
```{r}
as.numeric(months)
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

- Introduce an object consisting of the days of the week

- Make the object a factor; ensure that the days of the week are in chronological rather than alphabetical order

- Change the order of the levels to start with Sunday (in case your levels started with Sunday, change the order to start with Monday)

---

## Type Conversions
```{r}
# Get a numeric vector
x <- sample(1:10, 5)
x
# Create factor from numeric vector
fac_x <- factor(x)
fac_x

# Convert factor to numeric
as.numeric(fac_x) # Huh?
```
`as.numeric()` converts factors to their level numbers, not to their labels

---

## Type Conversions

```{r}
as.character(fac_x)
as.numeric(as.character(fac_x))
```
`as.character()` extracts the labels; you can then use `as.numeric` to get the labels' numeric value.

---

## Type Conversions

implicit type conversions happen all the time:
```{r}
x <- c("4.5", 3, TRUE, "elephant")
# The logical value becomes a character
x
```


Note that the cast from logical to  character doesn't survive intact
```{r}
as.numeric(x) 
```

---

## Basic Data Structures

Data structures hold one or more basic data types and may have multiple dimensions:

   | One type | Multiple Types
-- | -------- | --------------
1D | (Atomic) Vector | List
2D | Matrix | Data frame
nD | Array | 

An individual value ("scalar" in other languages) is a length one vector in R

* **Vectors**: one-dimensional array of values of the same type; vectors have a length, but no dimension

* **Matrix**: two-dimensional array of values of the same type; matrices have a dimension given as (row, column), length returns the number of items (row x column)

* **Array**: any higher dimensional array (e.g. output of temperature data from netcdf data)

---

## Basic Data Structures

`str()` can be used to examine a variable and determine its structure:

```{r, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, eval = -1}
library(tidyverse)
data("mtcars")
str(mtcars)
```
---

## Basic Data Structures

`str()` can be used to examine a variable and determine its structure:
```{r}
data("eurodist")
str(eurodist)
```
---

## Basic Data Structures

`str()` can be used to examine a variable and determine its structure:
```{r}
data("discoveries")
str(discoveries)
```
---

## Basic Data Structures

`str()` can be used to examine a variable and determine its structure:
```{r}
data("occupationalStatus")
str(occupationalStatus)
```
---

## Basic Data Structures

`str()` can be used to examine a variable and determine its structure:
```{r}
str(c(5:15))
str(month.name)
str(3)
str(mean)
```


---



## Data frames

Data frame: collection of vectors of same length but possibly different types
```{r}
L3 <- LETTERS[1:3]
d <- data.frame(
        x=1, 
        y=1:10, 
        fac=sample(L3, 10, replace=TRUE))
d %>% glimpse()
```

---

## Data frames are lists

But not all lists are data frames

```{r}
str(d)

mode(d)
```

Data frames are lists of vectors where each vector is constrained to have the same length

# Lists

---

## Lists

* lists allow the most flexibility, i.e. are not very structured. 

* a list element can be anything, including another list

* very useful (and common) as output from analytic methods

* lists can also be variables in a dataset

```{r}
mod<-glm(mpg~cyl+disp+hp+drat+wt, data=mtcars)
mode(mod)
```

---

## Lists are usually quite unwieldy

```{r}
str(mod)
```

---

## Working with lists

* single bracket operator [ ] returns a (usually smaller) list

```{r}
mod[c(1,6,8)]
```

---

## Working with lists 

* double bracket operator `[[ ]]` returns single list element (i.e. only single positive integer is allowed as index)

* similarly, named objects can be accessed using the `$` operator

```{r}
mod[[1]]
mod$rank
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn

The package `repurrrsive` helps with working with lists, it also has some fun data for us to work with.

- install the package `repurrrsive` 

- activate (using the function `data`) the object `got_chars` and check that it is a list.

- what does this object describe?

- can the object be converted to a data frame? If so, how? If not, why?

---
class: middle, center


... only once you tried, you know the drill :) ...

---

```{r}
# install.packages("repurrrsive")
library(repurrrsive)
data(got_chars) # Game of Thrones characters
is.list(got_chars)
mode(got_chars)
str(got_chars)
```

---

## Examining Lists

RStudio has a built-in list viewer
![Screenshot of list viewer](list_viewer.png)

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn


- extract the first element from `got_chars`. Which GoT character does it describe?

- is this character still alive?

- how many of the other characters are still alive? (This question is astonishingly tedious to answer with the tools we have discusses so far)

---

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
theon <- got_chars[[1]] # Gets 1st list element
str(theon) 
```

---

## Extracting Elements from Lists

```{r, collapse=T}
# Extracting elements by name:
theon[["tvSeries"]]
theon["culture"]
theon$alive
```

```{r, collapse=T}
# Extracting elements by position: 
theon[[3]]
theon[3:5]
```

## Indexing - Recap

So [what's the difference](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing) between `x$.`, `x[[.]]` and `x[.]`?

`x[.]`
- Returns a list
- Allows indexing by vectors


`x[[.]]`
- Returns a single element
- Selection by numerical or character index


`x$.`
- Returns a list component
- Indexing by component name (doesn't work on unnamed lists)
