## Rule 1:
### If you don't know what a file is <br>(or didn't create it) <br>don't commit it to git

---
## Rule 1
### If you don't know what a file is don't commit it to git

- `.Rproj`
- `.Rprofile`
- `.Rhistory`
- `.gitignore`
- `~.Rmd` (temporary save file)

## Rule 2
### Generated files should stay off git

--

(mostly)



---
## Rule 2
### Generated files should stay off git

- Derivative files have all of the same changes as the original
    - without the clarity - binary file formats
    - changes to pictures/HTML are easier to see in the markdown

- Merge conflicts are hard to resolve with only text!

---
## Rule 2
### Generated files should stay off git

Generated files (pdf, html, plots, etc) should not be committed to git unless...

--

- You are using github.io as a hosting service

- You often end up needing to reference them

- You and your collaborators agree about which files should be committed.

## Rule 3
### Secret files should stay off of git(hub)

- Passwords

- API keys

- Other secure information (SSN, bank account number, location of secret treasure maps)

- confidential data, or data your PI does not want to be published until after your thesis is submitted

Don't add these to git, don't push them to GitHub

---
## Rule 4
### Big files should stay out of Git

In theory, Git is intended for code, not data

- GitHub has a ~~100~~ 50 MB file size limit
    - Any push with "large" files will be rejected and you will have to undo it
    - This is a painful process

- Text data is usually fine (if small enough)

- Binary data and non-human-readable formats don't derive a lot of benefit from git's file tracking

## Keeping files off of git
.hard-right[![:scale 30%](https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/github-octocat.svg)]
The `.gitignore` file is found in the main project directory (aka project root, "./")

- You can add files to the list in `.gitignore` and git will ignore them

- You can push the `.gitignore` file if you want your collaborators to observe the same rules

- Wildcards also work - e.g. *.html will ignore all html files

## Blog Posts

We are using Mergify.io to automatically merge pull requests when you submit your blogs

Mergify *should* enforce the following rules: 

- __Do not modify LastnameFirstname.Rmd__
    - Your pull request should get a `modifies-template` label and you should get a reminder message

- __No spaces, numbers, or special characters in the filename.__     
`XxxxxYyyyy.Rmd` is the only pattern allowed

- __Do not commit .gitignore, .Rproj, or .Rprofile__

Any of these issues can cause your pull request to not be automatically merged.
